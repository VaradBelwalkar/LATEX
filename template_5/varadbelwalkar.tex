\runsubsection{Distortion effect VST Plugin in C++ using RackAFX} \location{Oct 2015}
Created VST audio plugins for guitar distortion effect, by digitally modeling the analog circuit. Programmed the plugin in C++ by utilizing open source VST plugin API, RackAFX and Visual Studio in Windows platform. Tested the plugin with in-built RackAFX frequency analyzers and in several Digital Audio Workstations.

\runsubsection{Short Time Fourier Transform of speech signal in C} \location{Sep 2014}
Designed an optimized STFT algorithm for analyzing the spectral behavior of speech signal. Applied strong programming skills in C as well as improvised the application by allowing users to choose window type, size and shifting length. Emphasized the representation of the STFT output by plotting time and frequency data.

\runsubsection{Variable fractional delay System Object in MATLAB and C++} \location{May 2015 – Aug 2015}
Developed the algorithm for variable fractional delaying with feedback using linear interpolation technique and circular buffering. Coded in C++ (MEX) and MATLAB (Codegen) and optimized the System object to run at 32 samples per frame without dropping any samples.

\runsubsection{Acoustic Echo Cancellation using NLMS in MATLAB} \location{Sep 2014}
Engineered a prototype model for AEC using normalized least mean square adaptive filtering in MATLAB. Used dry voice signal as far end and echoed far end convoluted with another dry voice signal as near end signal. Implemented NLMS algorithm to update adaptive filter coefficient. Verified the functionality by comparing output and the near end signal.

\runsubsection{Real-time compressor in audio DSP56300 using assembly language} \location{April – May 2014}

Implemented the audio compressor algorithm, which comprises of RMS filtering, threshold detecting, attack and release mechanisms in MATLAB to check numeric accuracy and performance. Optimized the algorithm and coded it in PPC block of Motorola audio DSP56300 using assembly language. Evaluated the real-time performance of the process using DVD and microphone input and speaker output.

\runsubsection{The COP Robot} \location{April – May 2015}
Engineered an autonomous object-tracking robot that runs in open source computer vision tool OpenCV. Customized DFRobot Turtle 2WD mobile robot to design a robot with Raspberry Pi, Arduino and L293D bridge motor controller. Programmed the code in Python using OpenCV library for object detection and Arduino board serial communication.
